## About
An app that allows student football players to showcase their skills to scouts.


### ✅ Description and Purpose

College Football Scout Helper is a full-stack web application that helps college football clubs, intramural teams, and student players connect through a centralized scouting platform.

Student players verify their identity before creating a profile. The system then retrieves and automatically populates verified football information such as playing position, preferred foot, skill level, and performance statistics from a simulated player registry. Players can complete additional profile information such as their biography, profile image, and availability.

Team captains and coaches can browse player profiles, search for players based on specific criteria, maintain a scouting list, and invite promising players to team tryouts.

The goal of this application is to simplify player recruitment within a college environment by giving student athletes an opportunity to showcase their abilities while providing campus football teams with an efficient way to discover and recruit new talent.


### Inspiration

Many talented college students are interested in playing football but often do not know how to join a team or demonstrate their abilities to coaches. Likewise, college football clubs and intramural teams frequently rely on word-of-mouth, social media, or informal recommendations when recruiting players.

College Football Scout Helper was inspired by the idea of creating a dedicated scouting platform where student players can present their football experience and skills while allowing coaches and team captains to efficiently identify, evaluate, and recruit players who fit their team's needs.

### ✅ Player Identity and Profile Verification (Custom 1)

Student players must verify their identity using their first name, last name, and date of birth before creating a football profile.

The application checks the submitted details against a pre-seeded demo player registry. When a match is found, the system automatically populates verified football information, including:

- Primary and secondary playing positions
- Preferred foot
- Skill level
- Class year
- Goals
- Assists
- Clean sheets
- Games played

Verified football fields are read-only and cannot be manually changed by the player. Players can still add personal information such as their profile image, biography, and availability.

This feature uses simulated verification records for demonstration purposes and is not connected to an official sports governing body.

### ✅ Complete Player Registration

Verified football information is automatically locked after identity verification. Players only complete their account information, biography, profile image, and availability before creating their account.

### ✅ Verified Student Player Profiles

Student players can create and manage a verified football profile after completing the player verification process.

Each profile combines verified football information retrieved from the demo player registry with player-provided information to create a trusted recruiting profile.

Players and recruiters can view:

- Verified player badge
- Profile image
- Biography
- Playing position
- Preferred foot
- Skill level
- Class year
- Career statistics
- Availability
- Team assignment
- Scouting status
- Recent tryout invitations
